I am a research assistant in the human memory and cognition laboratory under Dr. Aaron Benjamin at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One of the main projects I worked on within this lab involved researching eye movement and pupil dilation in a perceptual task. The goal of this study was to investigate how these eye-tracking metrics differed between fixed-paced and self-paced conditions. This study hypothesized that under self-paced conditions, participants would have larger pupil dilation and more stable fixations at the center of the screen. To investigate these questions, I utilized an eye-tracking device to collect participant data. This process familiarized me with different eye-tracking techniques and gave me a deeper understanding of how to interpret data. At the end of this project, my colleagues and I engaged in exploring and analyzing our collected data, which enhanced my understanding of R programming and data visualization techniques.

   Currently, my research interests lie in a variety of different domains within cognitive neuroscience. One area of research I am interested in studying is emotion, particularly how individuals from diverse populations interpret emotions. Emotion is an incredibly profound area of research as it is an important aspect of human well-being and overall health.  I am specifically interested in developing effective interventions for individuals with different affective disorders. In addition to emotion, I am also fascinated by human memory and cognition, with a focus on false memory and the interplay between aging and memory. 

   I am interested in the ways that we can answer these questions using coding and I am eager to gain more expereinces computing within the humanities.
